Parse_CSV-
==========

This code tends to accepts user input from command prompt containing column names from an available csv file like any of these-
e.g.1: "State","Crime"
e.g.2: "State", "Type of crime"
e.g.3: "State"

And outputs a CSV file containing the aggregate of input columns and a column with values Sum of count is appended to each row, such that you group rows for each unique combination of the input columns and sum the "Count" column for those rows.
